# Introuction

<p>Whenever we hear of a social media app, what comes in mind is a heavy app where you can upload and share phtos and  that's it. But Tris is way different than any social media you would have ever heard of</p><br>
<p>Almost every day we come to know about some data leak from tech giants which results to loss of privacy and much more. And over that what can you hope from a social media?(except of uploading posts and connecting to communnity) Well, this is where Tris comes in. </p>

# Platform Overview

<p>Tris is a decentralised social media app similar to Facebook or Twitter but totally decentralised. Every single user data from the user profile picture to his followers are stored in a smart contract that is deployed on the Polygon blockchain via Alchemy. </p>
- Super secure and user friendly login with metamask, which logs you in with just a click.
